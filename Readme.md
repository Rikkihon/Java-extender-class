      Define a class named Employee whose objects are records for employees. 
		  Derive this class from the class Person class included in this folder. 
		  An employee has an aggregated address class. 
		  Address contains Street Name, city, zip code (numeric),
		  State, and isCurrentAddress (Boolean) fields.  
		  An employee record inherits an employeeâ€™s name from the class Person. 
		  In addition, an employee record contains an annual salary represented 
		  As a single value of type double, a hire date that gives the year hired as a single value of type int,
		  & an identification number that is a value of type String.
	    Give your class a reasonable complement of constructors, accessor methods, and mutator methods,
		  as well as an equals method. There are Fulltime and Part time employees, you will be applying the concepts of 
      polymorphism to create these two types of employees. Check if the employee is full time or part time. 
		  Write a program to fully test your class definition and all your methods.
